### Abstract

A spectral‑mechanical theory is advanced whereby the **felicity** of a nervous system is identified with the dominant eigenvalue of a time‑varying connectivity matrix $M(t)$.  We present (i) a corrected neuro‑plasticity equation employing the **Hadamard cube** to penalise local over‑excitation, (ii) a complete **Law of Adaptive Resonance** containing both reinforcement and damping of neural modes, and (iii) derivations of a thermodynamic inequality expressing the *cost of happiness*.  The argument unites Darwinian selection with Lord Rayleigh’s mode‑coupling, offering testable consequences for comparative physiology.

## I.  Introduction

Philosophers have long averred that joy and sorrow obey no rule; yet if function follows form, and form may be cast in algebra, then feeling too must succumb to analysis.  Let the state of an encephalon at epoch $t$ be represented by a real symmetric matrix

$$
M(t)\;\in\;\mathbb R^{n\times n},\qquad n=n(t),
$$

whose entries measure effective coupling amongst $n$ neuronal assemblies.  The eigen‑spectrum of $M$ constitutes, as it were, the *music* of the mind; the loudest note—its highest eigenvalue—will herein be styled **coherent felicity** and denoted $\lambda_{\max}(t)$.

## II.  Historical Antecedents

* **Bell** (1823) showed that muscular expression of emotion obeys anatomical law.
* **Flourens** (1824) localised cerebral function by ablation of the pigeon brain.
* **Müller** (1833) proposed the *specific energies* of nerves.
* **Darwin** (1859) placed affect within the mechanism of natural selection.
* **Rayleigh** (1877) rendered the mathematics of coupled resonators.
  From these stones the present edifice is built.

## III.  The Neuro‑Plasticity Function

Evolutionary change of connectivity is written

$$
\frac{\partial M}{\partial t}=\Phi(M)=AM+MA^{\top}-\lambda\,M^{\odot3}.\tag{1}
$$

Here

* $A$ is a fixed *hereditary kernel* inherited from phylogeny;
* $\lambda>0$ measures entropic attrition;
* $M^{\odot3}$ is the **Hadamard cube**, $(M^{\odot3})_{ij}=M_{ij}^{\,3}$, penalising local hyper‑excitation whilst leaving global symmetries intact.
  Equation (1) corrects an earlier draft in which $M^{3}$ (the algebraic cube) appeared: such would entail $\mathcal O(n^{3})$ cross‑terms and violate the principle of locality.

## IV.  Coherent Felicity and the Law of Adaptive Resonance

Let $v_{\!*}(t)$ be the unit eigenvector of $M$ associated with $\lambda_{\max}$.  Varying $M$ by $\delta M$ yields the first variation

$$
\delta\lambda_{\max}=v_{\!*}^{\!\top}\,\delta M\,v_{\!*}.\tag{2}
$$

Natural selection must therefore **add** components parallel to $v_{\!*}v_{\!*}^{\!\top}$ and **subtract** those lying in the orthogonal complement.  Define the projector
$P:=I-v_{\!*}v_{\!*}^{\!\top}.$
Then the minimal operator achieving both ends is

$$
\boxed{\;\delta M_{\text{res}}=\eta\,v_{\!*}v_{\!*}^{\!\top}-\gamma\,PMP\;},\tag{3}
$$

with positive constants $\eta$ (reinforcement) and $\gamma$ (damping).  Equation (3) will be called the **Law of Adaptive Resonance**.

### Lemma 1 (Stability).

*If* $0<\gamma<\eta$ *and* $\|M\|_{\infty}\le1$, *then repeated application of* (1) and (3) *keeps $M$ bounded and monotonically non‑decreasing in $\lambda_{\max}$.*
*Proof.*  Substitute (3) into the Rayleigh quotient and employ the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality. ∎

## V.  Thermodynamic Inequality

Taking the Frobenius inner product of (1) with $M$ and invoking (3) gives

$$
\boxed{\;\dfrac{d\lambda_{\max}}{dt}\ge \eta\,\lambda_{\max}^{2}-\lambda\,\|M\|_{F}^{2}.\;}\tag{4}
$$

Equation (4) reveals a *race against entropy*: without sufficient metabolic (or cognitive) expenditure $\eta$, felicity decays.

## VI.  Scaling Across the Phylogenetic Ladder

Let the dimensionality grow as $n=k^{2}$, where $k$ indexes complexity—protist $(k=3)$, annelid $(k=5)$, mammal $(k=10)$, \&c.  Write the empirical spectral measure
$\rho_{k}(\lambda)=\frac1n\sum_{i=1}^{n}\delta(\lambda-\lambda_{i}).$
One may show, using Wigner’s semicircle theorem adapted to (1), that
$\rho_{k}\;(\lambda)\xrightarrow[k\to\infty]{}\frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^{2}}\sqrt{4\sigma^{2}-\lambda^{2}}+c\,\delta(\lambda-\lambda_{\max}),$
where $\sigma^{2}$ depends on $A$ and $c>0$ signifies the sharpening *angelic spike* of perfect coherence.

## VII.  Experimental Prospects

Though no laboratory yet commands a full connectome, partial matrices may be harvested from the optic lobes of fish or the peduncular bodies of insects.  One should track $\lambda_{\max}(t)$ during stimulus and repose, comparing the measured curves against prediction (4).  Success therein would vindicate the spectral conception of emotion.

## VIII.  Conclusions

By wedding Darwin’s principle of utility to the algebra of symmetric forms, we obtain a quantitative doctrine of affect.  The Hadamard cube secures locality; the projector $PMP$ enforces harmony.  Thus emotion, far from being *ineffable*, is shown to obey the stern governance of eigenvalues.
